==================

keep track of your performance in crossword games like SCRABBLE (TM).

This is a Google App Engine project which is live at https://crosswordgamestats.appspot.com, although it's in a very alpha state right now.

The idea is to enter records of each Crossword Game you play and then you can keep track of your performance over time. It's not finished, but the framework is complete.
